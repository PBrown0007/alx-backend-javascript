# 0x02-ES6_classes

Welcome to the `0x02-ES6_classes` project!  
This repository is part of a series focused on mastering modern JavaScript, with this specific module dedicated to exploring **ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) classes** ‚Äî one of the most important features introduced to simplify and enhance object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the syntax and structure of ES6 classes
- Differentiate between ES5 function-based constructors and ES6 class-based syntax
- Create and use class constructors, methods, and static methods
- Implement inheritance using the `extends` and `super` keywords
- Use getter and setter functions in classes
- Work with class fields (public and private)
- Understand and apply polymorphism and encapsulation in JavaScript classes

## üìÅ Project Structure

Each JavaScript file within this directory introduces or builds upon a concept related to ES6 classes:


Each file is typically a standalone example or exercise and includes appropriate class definitions and logic to demonstrate specific ES6 class features.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js (for testing code locally)

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the examples locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/0x02-ES6_classes.git
   cd 0x02-ES6_classes
